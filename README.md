Visualisation of which colors pass a contrast ratio check, for accessibility purposes ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)).

This script enables bulk visualisation, instead of single-color contrast tests of online tools like [this](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

On the left side, a slice of the color cube is shown, at the slider-provided red value. The colors shown are ones that pass the contrast test - everything else is transparent.

You can select 1-3 colors for comparing against the color cube colors.

The associated checkboxes apply the corresponding constraint that the contrast ratio between those colors and the color cube slice should be >= the specified minimum contrast ratio.

You can visualise the colors and the hovered (via mouse) color as foreground/background and vice versa.

Enjoy!
